Reusable 3D-printable designs

*.scad files - source for some 3D-printed objects, created with OpenSCAD.

To use:
 Download and install openscad - http://www.openscad.org/

Edit and preview the design using openscad.  Save if changed.

Export as .STL from openscad.

Load into your 3D printer's slicer software, and generate the
printer-specific .gcode or other printer control file.  Run that on the 3D
printer.
